  <p>People do recover and go on to live well after experiencing suicidal thoughts and after attempting suicide. It is important to remember that feeling low does not necessarily mean that you will feel as low as you have done in the past.  Think about the things and people who have helped you before and act on those things. </p>
  <p>Estimates indicate that 80% of people feel suicidal at some point in their life, so it is not unusual to feel this way.  The important thing is to know you are not alone, you can access a wide range of support, and there are things you can do to feel better.</p>
