### prevention


This project aims to provide an online source of information and support for those affected by suicide. It will offer advice for people who are feeling suicidal, those that are concerned about the welfare of someone else, individuals who have contemplated suicide in the past, and anyone bereaved by suicide. The focus will be on the Stockport and Greater Manchester area, with links and resources to services available locally, but the advice and stategies for support will be applicable to anyone affected by suicide.

The site was primarily designed for desktop use but effort has been put in to make it responsive and accessible on a variety of screen sizes and devices. Tools including [Flexbox](http://flexboxin5.com/) (where browser compatible), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [media queries](http://mediaqueri.es/) and [vanilla](http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Vanilla) CSS have been utilised to ensure none of the content, functionality or readibility is sacrified when viewed using a smaller device.

This project will be published using [GitHub Pages](http://stockport.github.io/), and developed using Jekyll for HTML & CSS templating. The project also makes use of the prose.io content editing system to simplify the contribution process for collaborators.  

To run a copy of this project locally:

Ensure you have the [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) blogging platform installed  
```git clone``` from the link on the right and ```cd ``` into the folder  
```jekyll serve```  
navigate to ```localhost:4000```
