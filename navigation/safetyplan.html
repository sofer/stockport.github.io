  <h1><p class="blue-text">Safety Plan</p></h1>
  <p>Can I help myself? Yes, you can! You can remind yourself how you have succeeded in keeping yourself safe in the past and try to use those techniques again. Sometimes, when things are difficult, it can be hard to remember these things, so it can be useful to write them down as part of a Safety Plan. Fill in the boxes below, then print the page. Keep your safety plan in a safe place where you can easily access it (e.g. wallet, purse, phone).</p>
